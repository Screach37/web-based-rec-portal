# Recruitment Portal

This project is a web-based recruitment portal built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It aims to streamline the recruitment process by providing a platform where recruiters can post job openings and manage applicants, and applicants can apply for jobs and track their application status.
